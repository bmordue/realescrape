<div class="pd_description"><p>Discover a wealth of accommodation and incredible gardens, including approximately two acres of land, with this rarely available stone-built detached villa which also has a separate detached cottage &ndash; both peacefully situated amongst open countryside by the exclusive seaside village of St Cyrus.</p>  <p>Gamekeepers Cottage is an exceptional three/four-bedroom stone-built villa with a separate one-bedroom dwelling, which are both surrounded by roughly two acres of private land, incorporating stunning gardens and a dense wooded area. Both properties are bright and spacious too, and both are in excellent decorative order with light interiors and&nbsp;southeast-facing aspects. The main villa further boasts three reception rooms and spectacular country and seaside views. Extensive parking is also provided for both residences via a private driveway. This is an outstanding and rarely available prospect that offers a sought-after coast and country lifestyle in a truly scenic location that provides a sense of seclusion, whilst still retaining excellent convenience, being close to the village of St Cyrus. It also offers a wealth of opportunities, with the self-contained second dwelling proving ideal for independent family members and the holiday rental market &ndash; especially with the amazing nearby beaches.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The approach to Gamekeepers Cottage is nothing short of spectacular, encompassing wonderful views, as well as the home&rsquo;s manicured gardens and woodland. Stepping inside, a dual-aspect porch and central hall (with storage) continue the strong first impression, providing a hint of the accommodation to follow.</p>  <p>Gamekeepers Cottage boasts three large reception rooms, providing buyers with flexibility and a wealth of space. The living room is the main reception area, centred around a beautiful open fireplace that creates a focal point for lounge furniture. It is bathed in all-day sun from dual-aspect windows to the southwest and southeast, and it is&nbsp;enhanced by crisp neutral d&eacute;cor and snug carpeting. A southeast-facing formal dining room, framed by a traditional stone mantelpiece, has a similar aesthetic. Facing the home&rsquo;s front, like the living room, it also enjoys far-reaching country views to the sea &ndash; a perfect backdrop for family meals. A multi-aspect sunroom, with rear garden access, provides a third reception area which is spacious enough for both lounge and dining furniture. It also enjoys delightful panoramic views of the garden.</p>  <p>Openly connected to the sunroom, the dining kitchen is a light-filled space, which is further accentuated by a neutral colour palette. It is fitted with cream- coloured cabinets and stone-effect worktops, providing plenty of storage and workspace. It has a central area for a dining table for casual meals; plus, it comes with an Aga cooker, an integrated dishwasher, further built-in storage, and room for freestanding appliances. A rear porch provides an additional cupboard and rear garden access, and it also connects to a handy WC/utility room with further space for appliances.</p>  <p>The three bedrooms are on the first floor, connected to a naturally-lit landing with a large store. Each room echoes the aesthetic of the living area, enjoying a bright and calming ambience. The principal bedroom is a spacious double with built-in wardrobes and dual- aspect windows, which frame uninterrupted country and seaside views. The second bedroom is also a large double, whilst the third bedroom provides excellent versatility, and could be used as an office if required. If needed, the formal dining room could also be used as a fourth bedroom too, ensuring excellent flexibility for homeowners and growing families.</p>  <p>In addition to the WC/utility room, Gamekeepers Cottage has a lovely family bathroom with a fitting nautical theme, finished with tongue and groove panelling (painted light blue) and topped with white d&eacute;cor &ndash; an effective look. It has a four-piece suite too, comprised of a pedestal washbasin, a toilet, a bathtub, and a separate shower cubicle.</p>  <p>For year-round comfort, Gamekeepers Cottage has oil-fired central heating and double-glazed windows, with a couple of secondary-glazed windows too.</p>  <p>The Cottage; A second dwelling for guests</p>  <p>Well-presented throughout, this cottage features a welcoming hall and living room, with charming exposed stone work and dual-aspect windows; a large dining kitchen with integrated appliances and a box bay window; a double bedroom with a built-in wardrobe and box bay window; and, a three-piece shower room. It also has oil-fired central heating and double glazing.</p>  <p>Enveloped by roughly two acres of land, the main property and additional cottage both enjoy an abundance of outdoor space, including stunning wraparound gardens that are fully enclosed and carefully landscaped. Highly scenic and magical, these gardens are designed for the entire family, incorporating neat patios and expansive lawns, adorned with colourful&nbsp;planting and mature trees. There is also a vegetable garden and established fruit trees too. Furthermore, there is a large wooded area ripe for exploration. Private parking for multiple vehicles is provided as well, via a gated front driveway. &nbsp;</p>  <p>Extras: all fitted floor and window coverings, light fittings, integrated kitchen appliances, and an Aga cooker to be included in the sale.</p>  <p>St Cyrus</p>  <p>Situated along the coast, equidistant between the cities of Dundee and Aberdeen, St Cyrus is a charming seaside village flanked by open countryside and volcanic cliffs, leading down to a sprawling sandy beach which runs for 3 miles to the mouth of the River North Esk. It is an incredibly picturesque location that offers endless walking opportunities and a wealth of outdoor pursuits, including the St Cyrus National Nature Reserve, which is known as one of the richest and most diverse nature reserves in Britain. Naturally, the area is perfect for wildlife spotting with a wide variety of birds and marine life, with whales, dolphins, and&nbsp;seals all spotted in the coastal waters. Furthermore, fishing can be enjoyed at the nearby River North Esk, whilst golfers are spoilt for choice thanks to excellent golf courses at Montrose, Edzell, and Brechin, and under an hour away by car is the world-famous Carnoustie&rsquo;s championship course. The village provides a post office, a hotel, a caf&eacute;, and a convenience store, whereas more extensive shopping facilities are on offer just a ten minutes&rsquo; drive away at Montrose. Primary education is provided locally, with secondary schooling available at Montrose and Laurencekirk, and at the well-regarded private Lathallan School. Connected&nbsp;by the A92 and A90, St Cyrus provides easy access to the surrounding coastal towns and villages, from Stonehaven to the north, and south to Arbroath. It is also under an hour by car to both Dundee and Aberdeen, placing further retail and cultural facilities at your disposal, as well as two major airports with domestic and European flights, including direct services to London Stansted. Furthermore, nearby Montrose is on the main east coast railway line, with a sleeper service to the south and regular commuter trains to Aberdeen.</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;A large detached villa and separate cottage</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Approximately two acres of private land</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Stunning country a & coastal location by St Cyrus</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Spectacular countryside and sea views</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect porch and bright hall with storage</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect living room with open fireplace</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Versatile formal dining room/fourth bedroom</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Multi-aspect sunroom with garden access</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dining kitchen openly connected to sunroom &bull; &nbsp;Rear porch with storage and garden access</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Naturally-lit landing with a large store</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Two spacious and airy double bedrooms</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Versatile third bedroom/home office</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;4pc bathroom and separate WC/utility room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Oil-fired central heating and double glazing</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Roughly two acres of private wooded land</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Stunning, landscaped wraparound gardens</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Gated front driveway for multiple vehicles</p> </div>
