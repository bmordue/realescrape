<div class="pd_description"><p>This truly unique architect-designed detached country villa is an incredible four-bedroom home which was newly built in 2019 by a master timber framer, offering substantial accommodation covering over 4193 square feet across three floors.</p> <p>Backed by a mature tree line and enveloped by far-reaching countryside, the magnificent Cantsmill Cottage is an exclusive four-bedroom newly-built detached villa with a breath-taking rural location just a ten minutes&rsquo; drive from the heart of Kirriemuir. This bespoke family home offers a peaceful retreat, abounding with spectacular country views at every turn. It further boasts a wealth of accommodation which has been carefully crafted to maximise space and light, immediately capturing your attention with a host of desirable features and exquisite woodwork by a master timber framer. It includes two reception rooms, two kitchens, three bathrooms, and four double bedrooms, whilst also benefitting from suntrap, wraparound gardens and extensive private parking, including a huge professional workshop/garage. The interiors also provide a blank canvas for new buyers, with neutral d&eacute;cor throughout and spaces ready for new carpets, allowing you to create the aesthetic to suit your style. Highly sophisticated and luxurious, this outstanding home requires viewing to properly appreciate its magnitude and scenic location.</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; Step inside a true rural idyll</p> <p>With its stone and timber fa&ccedil;ade and imposing stature, Cantsmill Cottage instantly conjures the image of a rural idyll. Inside, the interiors reinforce the promise, starting with a welcoming vestibule that flows into a hall with storage.</p> <p>Reception rooms &ndash; Discover eye-catching reception rooms</p> <p>The open-plan kitchen, living and dining room is the show-stopping centrepiece of Cantsmill Cottage. This one-of-a-kind reception area has substantial dimensions for a wide assortment of furnishings and it boasts a majestic double-height apex ceiling framed by an incredible feature window and exposed wooden beams. With further multi-aspect glazing and French doors to outside, it captures the magic of the surrounding scenery, ensuring an unparalleled bright and airy atmosphere. It is truly stunning in every sense of the word.</p> <p>On the first floor, a spacious sitting room provides a closer look at the ornate timber ceiling work. This reception area enjoys a mezzanine-style layout too, overlooking the living space and its grand feature window. Additional full-height glazing adds to the light-filled environment, gifting the room with further leafy views.</p> <p>Kitchens &ndash; Shaker-inspired kitchen with a central island and breakfast bar</p> <p>Nestled to the front of the open-plan reception room, the main kitchen is neatly zoned behind a central island with a breakfast bar. It has a Shaker-inspired design that is attractive to the eye and practical, featuring white cabinets and luxury worktops. It houses a gas range cooker and an Esse Ironheart solid fuel cooker, and comes with deep dual sinks and an integrated dishwasher. The countryside backdrop brings an additional touch of inspiration whilst cooking.</p> <p>On the lower ground floor, there is an annexe suite that is fitted with base cabinets topped with wood-toned worktops, housing an integrated oven, electric hob, and a sink. This room has a generous footprint (laid with wooden floorboards) and it is brightly illuminated by twin southeast-facing windows. With an alternate entrance/exit to the side of the home and a neighbouring shower room, this space offers a wealth of creative potential to compliment your lifestyle. Potentially, it could be used as an art studio, a guest suite, or for independent family members. Also at this level, there is a discreet utility room with a generous store.</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Spacious double bedrooms with inspiring views</p> <p>The four bedrooms are all spacious doubles with inspiring country and tree-lined views. All the rooms continue the charm of exposed wooden ceiling beams and all (except bedroom three) have dual-aspect windows as well, to make the most of the views whilst adding to the light and airy ambience. The principal and second bedrooms are on the first floor, off a landing lit by skylights, with bedrooms three and four easily accessible on the ground floor.</p> <p>If preferred, the new homeowners could use an alternative layout, as the mezzanine-style sitting room was originally intended to be a principal suite with the current principal bedroom already plumbed for use as an en-suite bathroom. It grants the new owners additional flexibility to suit their lifestyle.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; A bathroom on every floor</p> <p>For maximum convenience, Cantsmill Cottage has a bathroom on every floor. At the lower ground level, there is a three-piece shower room, with tongue-and-groove panelling and a double step-in shower cubicle. A modern three-piece shower room serves the ground floor, providing a double walk-in shower enclosure. On the first floor, there is a spacious bathroom, with characterful timber ceiling beams and a four-piece suite, comprised of a toilet, a storage-set washbasin, a bath, and a separate shower cubicle.</p> <p>For maximum comfort, the property has double glazing and oil-fired underfloor heating throughout the entire cottage. A brand-new septic tank was also installed in 2025.</p> <p>Garden & Parking &ndash; Wraparound gardens and extensive parking</p> <p>Mature gardens wraparound the entirety of the property, providing neat lawns from which to admire the country panorama. The rear garden has the added advantage of a southeast-facing aspect, capturing an abundance of sun throughout the day. Also to the rear, there is a private driveway leading to a massive professional workshop/integral garage, which has 3-phase wiring, space for multiple vehicles, storage, and convenient access to the hall of the lower ground floor. It is an impressive space that offers a wealth possibilities.</p> <p>Extras: all light fittings, gas range cooker, Esse Ironheart solid fuel cooker, and integrated dishwasher to be included in the sale.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Kirriemuir</p> <p>The charming town of Kirriemuir, known locally as Kirrie, is the &ldquo;Gateway to the Glens&rdquo; and lies just under six miles from Angus&rsquo; county town of Forfar. Kirriemuir is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Sir JM Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, whose childhood home in the town is now a museum. There is a statue of Peter Pan in the middle of the town, and Barrie gifted a camera obscura to the people of the town, along with the cricket pavilion in which it is housed, which is a popular tourist attraction, from which panoramic views of the surrounding countryside can be enjoyed. The town is home to excellent amenities, including a supermarket, a minimarket, a number of independent retailers, a bakery, a butcher&rsquo;s shop, a Post Office, caf&eacute;s, coffee shops, bars, a restaurant, and takeaways, as well as hairdressers, a barber, and beauty salons. More extensive shopping facilities, including high street stores and ASDA and Tesco Superstores, can be found in nearby Forfar. Kirriemuir hosts an annual traditional music festival and the town hall offers events throughout the year such as plays and concerts, whilst the town also enjoys a number of community and sports groups, and a sports centre with a swimming pool and gym. For those who prefer spending time outdoors, Kirriemuir has a number of parks and its own golf course, with no shortage of walking, cycling and running routes in the surrounding countryside. Schooling is well catered for in the town, with two primary schools (Northmuir and Southmuir) and a secondary school, Webster&rsquo;s High School. Kirriemuir is well connected to the rest of the county and further afield, owing to excellent bus and road links</p> <ul> <li>Substantial open-plan kitchen/living/dining room with:</li> <li>Majestic double-height apex ceiling</li> <li>French doors extending to outside</li> <li>Shaker-inspired kitchen with a central island</li> <li>Mezzanine-style sitting room overlooking the living area</li> <li>Annexe suite with creative potential</li> <li>Principal bedroom plumbed for an en-suite bathroom</li> <li>Three additional spacious and airy double bedrooms</li> <li>A four-piece family bathroom with a shower cubicle</li> <li>Oil-fired underfloor heating and double-glazed windows</li> <li>EPC C</li> </ul></div>
