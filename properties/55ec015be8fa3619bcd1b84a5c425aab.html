				<h2>Seaview Hotel, 29 Ireland<br>Street DD7 6AS</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;445,000</h4>
<h3>Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">6</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>Arranged over three floors, Seaview is a traditional detached villa that has a floorplan covering over 3,421 square feet to provide its inhabitants with an impressive amount of space. The property has been extended as well, adding further accommodation. It enjoys sympathetic interior design and well-preserved period features, which work together to create an inviting ambience and a sense of grandeur. It boasts three reception rooms, a modern dining kitchen, a family shower room, and six double bedrooms all of which have their own en-suite. Unsurprisingly, the property has been used as a successful B&B and (latterly) on Airbnb. The new owners could continue the villa as a lucrative business venture or utilise it as a significant luxury home for extended families. Substantial private parking and well-maintained gardens add to the villa&rsquo;s allure, along with its central location. Situated in the heart of Carnoustie, Seaview is just a short walk from all the town offers, including bus and rail links, schools, amenities, the glorious beachfront, and world-famous golf facilities.</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; Welcome to Seaview</p> <p>Seaview has an inspiring profile. Stepping inside, the attraction continues with a reception hall that exudes warmth and sophistication thanks to soothing d&eacute;cor and a herringbone floor. Ornate period flourishes bring further aesthetic charm hinting at the exceptional features to follow. There is also generous storage and a convenient WC.</p> <p>Reception rooms &ndash; Three dedicated reception rooms</p> <p>The living room is an expansive space that accommodates a wide range of furnishings. It has a south-facing aspect for a flood of natural light and it is lovingly presented in a neutral hue that contrasts nicely with the hardwood floor. What immediately catches the eye, however, is the wonderfully ornate ceiling panel and stunning focal-point fireplace, which has the most impressive mantelpiece and surround. A picture rail adds the finishing touch. Next door, the formal dining room provides a spacious setting for seated meals. It also basks in southerly light and has an open archway connecting to the dining kitchen for convenience. The third reception area is a dual-aspect games room that offers space for a pool table and direct access to the main garden. Furthermore, it has a built-in sauna for relaxation, with a three-piece family shower room nearby as well.</p> <p>Kitchen &ndash; A Shaker-inspired design that blends functionality and style</p> <p>The dining kitchen has a Shaker-inspired design that blends functionality and style. It can accommodate an eight-person table and it boasts ample cabinet storage, alongside generous workspace and splashback panels in an elegant stone-effect finish. It also has access to the rear garden and includes a gas range cooker, an extractor hood, two fridge/freezers, a dishwasher, and a washing machine.</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Six large bedrooms</p> <p>Six expansive double bedrooms are located throughout Seaview, offering a peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep. These rooms are thoughtfully decorated to reflect the building&rsquo;s historic character and to emphasise the many original features they contain, which include highly intricate cornice work, decorative ceiling roses, and detailed ceiling friezes. The bay-windowed principal suite and bedrooms four, five, and six all have their own en-suite shower room too, whilst bedrooms two and three have en-suite bathrooms fitted with overhead showers. Extending off a naturally-lit landing (with an airing cupboard) the front-facing bedrooms on the upper floors also boast delightful sea views, in keeping with the namesake of this magnificent property. There are also three large stores on the ground floor that offer outstanding storage and excellent potential for creative use, such as an office or potentially additional bedrooms.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; Six en-suites, a family shower room, and a WC</p> <p>With the WC, family shower room, and six en-suites, this villa ensures zero waiting times. Every bathroom is of an excellent standard too, incorporating quality fixtures and fittings.</p> <p>For year-round comfort and efficiency, Seaview has gas central heating and double-glazed windows.</p> <p>Garden & Parking &ndash; A private sanctuary for relaxing and entertaining</p> <p>The property is enclosed by a high wall and fence, offering a private sanctuary for residents. It includes a substantial (gated) driveway that can welcome over a dozen vehicles with ease. There is also a rear garden with a patio, lawn, and planting beds, and there is a low-maintenance front garden that has an artificial lawn and a suntrap, south-facing aspect. The latter provides lots of space and a hot tub for added serenity.</p> <p>Extras: all fitted floor and window coverings, light fittings, a gas range cooker, an extractor hood, two fridge/freezers, a dishwasher, a washing machine, and a hot tub to be included in the sale.</p> <p>Situated just over ten miles from the city of Dundee, the coastal town of Carnoustie is a mecca for golf enthusiasts and famed for its world-class links golf course, laid host to the Open Golf Championship in 2018. With its foundations in local agriculture and the textile industry, this Angus town, founded in the 18th century, latterly found popularity as a Victorian seaside resort. In the last few decades, it has developed into an ideal spot for commuters. The town itself enjoys excellent local amenities, including supermarkets, shops, caf&eacute;s and restaurants, banking and a medical practice, in addition to primary and secondary schooling. A short drive away, the vibrant city of Dundee boasts a full range of high street outlets and a cultural hub, with museums including the world-renowned V&A Dundee. In addition to the championship course (regarded as amongst the toughest in the world), this stretch of the East Coast is well-known for its outstanding golf courses. The town is surrounded by the beautiful Angus countryside, and its coastal setting offers a wonderful seaside lifestyle, with a promenade, leisure centre, sports facilities and play area, and walks along long stretches of beach in the local area. The town benefits from excellent road links and a train station, with a direct service along the coast to Dundee, making it very well connected not only to the city but also to the surrounding area.</p> <ul> <li>A traditional detached villa covering 3421.9 sq ft</li> <li>Far-reaching sea views from the upper floors</li> <li>Expansive living room with a stunning freplace</li> <li>Dual-aspect games room with a built-in sauna</li> <li>Formal dining room openly connected to the kitchen</li> <li>Modern dining kitchen with Shaker-inspired design</li> <li>Six expansive double bedrooms that are light and airy</li> <li>Six quality en-suites (shower rooms and bathrooms)</li> <li>A family shower room with a convenient location</li> <li>Three large stores for storage and creative use</li> <li>Large, south-facing front garden with a hot tub</li> <li>Well-maintained rear garden with patio and lawn</li> <li>Substantial driveway with space for a dozen vehicles</li> <li>Gas central heating and double-glazed windows</li> </ul></div>
