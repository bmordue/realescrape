				<h2>4 Beechwood Terrace,<br>Dundee DD2 1NW</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;460,000</h4>
<h3>Terraced House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">5</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>Welcome to a stunning traditional mid-terrace house which offers a wealth of expansive accommodation that is highly versatile and finished to exceptionally high standards having been thoroughly refurbished. Boasting an elegant reception room, a stylish kitchen, four/five double bedrooms, and two contemporary bathrooms, this home is designed to impress.</p> <p>Following comprehensive refurbishment in 2020, this traditional four/five-bedroom mid-terrace house is an extraordinary family home that offers the striking combination of period elegance and contemporary comforts. It pairs sympathetic interior design with original features and luxurious finishings &ndash; all carefully curated to accentuate the home&rsquo;s impeccable character and style. The kitchen and bathrooms were all newly fitted during the renovation and the utmost care was taken to preserve the home's period details. The end result is a truly exceptional residence that meets all the needs of modern living, providing lots of interior space and landscaped gardens. Set on a quiet cul-de-sac in the West End Suburbs conservation area, it also enjoys a much sought-after setting in Dundee.</p> <p>Entering the home, you are welcomed by a vestibule (with renewed traditional floor tiles) flowing into a hall with further period flourishes. It is an impeccable introduction that immediately sets the tone of the interiors, echoing the style and quality of the accommodation found throughout. Built-in storage is on hand, along with a premium WC.</p> <p>The expansive living room is a highlight of this home, captivating visitors with its exquisite d&eacute;cor and ornate period features that immediately catch the eye. A lavish ceiling rose, intricate cornice work, and a magnificent feature fireplace elevate the room&rsquo;s regal elegance, along with the soothing tones and plush carpet. Meanwhile, a south-facing bay window ensures a flood of natural light, adding to the warm and welcoming environment.</p> <p>Designed with style and functionality in mind, the substantial breakfasting kitchen/dining room is the heart of the home for entertaining family and friends. It has a dedicated dining area, complemented by original features, and it is brightly illuminated by dual-aspect windows (to the north and south) ensuring a light-filled ambience. The kitchen itself features a Shaker-inspired design, with a wealth of cabinetry in a striking navy-blue finish. Marble-inspired worktops and metro-style splashbacks bring modern sophistication, while undercabinet lighting and a fitted breakfast bar enhance the practical design even further. In addition, it has an Insinkerator food waste disposal unit and an impressive range of integrated appliances, including a five-burner gas hob, a slimline extractor hood, two slide-and-hide Neff ovens, combi microwave oven, two fridge/freezers, and two dishwashers. A neighbouring utility room has a separate washer and dryer, and a boot room (with built-in storage) provides further convenience.</p> <p>A traditional staircase with an ornate balustrade leads to the first floor, where four bright and exceptionally spacious double bedrooms extend off a landing, which is illuminated by a stunning stained-glass window. Each bedroom reflects the living room&rsquo;s aesthetic, embodying the home&rsquo;s inviting style, with many also retaining similar period details. With its expansive proportions, the principal bedroom particularly stands out, exuding a sense of grandeur with its rich cornicing, detailed ceiling rose, and handsome feature fireplace. The other bedrooms are equally impressive in their size and style, with the front-facing rooms also boasting wonderful views over the River Tay.</p> <p>Back on the ground floor, a versatile fifth double bedroom adds further flexibility. Currently used as a study/home office and sitting area, it boasts a box bay window and an elegant mantelpiece, framed by a bold accent wall. In addition, there is also a substantial, fully-floored attic offering excellent storage and potential for creative use.</p> <p>Set on the first floor, the home&rsquo;s bathroom and shower room are both immaculately presented and finished to a high specification, compete with premium tile work and contemporary three-piece suites. The bathroom includes a storage-set washbasin, a toilet, an illuminated mirror, a ladder-style towel radiator, and a bath with an overhead shower. The shower room offers similar fixtures, but with a double walk-in shower cubicle and rainfall showerhead instead of a bath. Both showers also work off the systems boiler, which has a brass pump circulating hot water throughout the home, ready for instant use.</p> <p>The property has gas central heating (via a systems boiler) and refurbished sash-and-case windows that ensure a light-filled living environment.</p> <p>Outside, the south-facing front garden adds to the home&rsquo;s strong kerb appeal, enjoying a manicured lawn dotted with mature plants. To the rear, there is also a fully-enclosed garden providing a private locale for enjoying the summer months. It features a neat lawn and a patio for alfresco dining in the sun. Parking in the area is on street and unrestricted.</p> <p>Extras: all fitted floor coverings, window blinds and shutters, light fittings (except the study and dining room lights), and integrated kitchen appliances to be included in the sale.</p> <p>Scotland&rsquo;s fourth largest and notably sunniest city, Dundee, lies on the east coast, on the Firth of Tay estuary, and was recently voted by the Sunday Times as one of the top twelve places to live in Britain. A historic port and now a UNESCO City of Design, Dundee is brimming with culture; boasting a regenerated waterfront with two nautical museums (RRS Discovery, Captain Scott&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition ship, and the 19th-century warship, HM Frigate Unicorn) and the architectural triumph of the newly opened V & A Dundee, Scotland&rsquo;s first design museum. Further museums, arts centres and theatres can be found across the city, along with a vibrant array of bars and restaurants. A wildlife centre, cinemas and excellent sports and leisure facilities are also on offer. Largely walkable, Dundee provides a delightful and convenient shopping experience, hosting a wide selection of high-street retail outlets, shopping centres (one with a large public library) and supermarkets. The city provides education at all levels, with private and state institutions and one of the UK&rsquo;s leading universities. Major road and rail links connect Dundee to the rest of Scotland and further afield, whilst Dundee airport also offers flights to London City Airport.</p> <ul> <li>A traditional and expansive mid-terrace house</li> <li>Traditional vestibule and hall with storage and a WC</li> <li>Large living room with elegant original features</li> <li>Shaker-inspired breakfasting kitchen/dining room</li> <li>Separate utility room and boot room with storage</li> <li>Four expansive double bedrooms</li> <li>Versatile fifth double bedroom/study/sitting room</li> <li>Bathroom & shower room</li> <li>Carefully maintained front and enclosed rear gardens</li> <li>GCH, Sash-and-case windows; EPC D</li> </ul></div>
