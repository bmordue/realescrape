				<h2>Taymount House and Cottage,<br>Caputh PH1 4JJ</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;380,000</h4>
<h3>Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">4</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>This generous, traditional detached house (dating back to circa 1860) in Caputh offers four bedrooms, four reception areas, a breakfasting kitchen, and three bathrooms, plus an attached self-contained two-bedroom cottage, with both properties enjoying lovely mature gardens and private parking.</p> <p>Situated in the village of Caputh, in the heart of the Perth and Kinross countryside and close to the River Tay, this generous detached house offers beautifully presented, modern interiors, and comes with an attached, self-contained two-bedroom cottage with various options for use. The main house accommodates four bedrooms, multiple reception areas, and three bathrooms, and each property is accompanied by lovely mature gardens and excellent private parking. The property has been undergoing modernisation since 2019, with recent upgrades including a new kitchen, newly installed air-source heating and solar panels in the main house, and insulation. In addition to its tranquil semi-rural setting, Caputh enjoys easy access to nearby amenities and transport links. You are welcomed into the home by a spacious conservatory, offering a tranquil seating area in which to enjoy the garden all year round, with a wealth of glazing framing lovely open views and capturing sunny natural light throughout the day. An internal hall (with storage) sets the tone for the interiors to follow, with attractive blue d&eacute;cor and a fitted carpet. A sunroom is also accessed from the hall, currently utilised as a children&rsquo;s playroom and offering various options for use.</p> <p>The living room is elegantly presented with understated neutral decor and wood-styled flooring, and it provides plenty of space for configurations of furniture, all arranged around a multi-fuel stove, creating a warm atmosphere during the colder months. The neighbouring family room represents a more informal space for relaxing as a family and also features a cosy multi-fuel stove. It has chic grey decor and a fitted carpet for optimum comfort underfoot. The dining room has a wealth of south-facing glazing capturing wonderful southerly sunshine and framing far-reaching views of the adjacent countryside. Plenty of space is provided here for a large dining table and chairs alongside additional furniture, offering an ideal space for family meals and entertaining with guests - perfect for those who love to host dinner parties.</p> <p>The kitchen is very well-appointed with contemporary pale grey walls and cabinets with under counter lighting, ample coordinating worktops, and chic metro-tiled splashbacks. Integrated appliances comprise an oven, an induction hob, an extractor hood, and a wine cooler, whilst provision is made for a freestanding American-style fridge/freezer and a dishwasher. A breakfast bar caters for morning coffee, busy weekday breakfasts, and socialising while cooking, and the kitchen is supplemented by a useful pantry/ utility cupboard and a two-piece WC.</p> <p>The home has four well-proportioned double bedrooms, with one on the ground floor and the remaining three on the first floor, all enjoying neutral d&eacute;cor (one with an elegant feature wall) and comfortable fitted carpets. One of the remaining bedrooms also has an en-suite shower room, whilst either bedroom three or four could be utilised as a home office, ideal for those requiring a quiet space to work or study from home. The ground floor principal bedroom has dual-aspect windows, with one south-facing and boasting wonderful open views of the countryside, and it is also supplemented by a built-in wardrobe and an en-suite shower room. The principal bedroom's en-suite comprises a shower enclosure, a basin set into storage, and a WC, whilst bedroom two's shower room comes stylishly appointed with a large shower enclosure, a vanity unit with an inset basin, a WC, and a chrome towel radiator, all enveloped by chic wall and foor tiling. A separate family bathroom, which is tiled the same as bedroom two&rsquo;s en-suite, completes the accommodation on offer and comprises a bath with an overhead shower and a glazed screen, and a traditionally styled WC-suite. The main house has an air-source heating system, solar panels, and partial double glazing.</p> <p>SELF-CONTAINED COTTAGE</p> <p>The house has a unique feature of an attached, self-contained cottage that could lend itself to a variety of uses. It is currently utilised as a successful holiday let and could continue this use by the new owner, or alternatively, it could be used as separate accommodation for elderly live-in relatives or older children. The cottage has its own private entrance porch opening into an open-plan living area, where the kitchen is appointed with contemporary white wall and base cabinets, marble-inspired worktops, and neutral splashback tiling, as well as integrated appliances comprising an oven, hob, and extractor hood, whilst provision is made for a fridge/freezer, a washing machine, and a dishwasher. The kitchen also has a breakfast bar with seating for two. The living area has a handsome stone feature wall framing a warming multi-fuel stove, and it offers space for lounge furniture. The stylish shower room is accessed from here and comprises a walk-in shower enclosure with a rainfall showerhead, a basin set into storage, and a WC. The lower-ground level of the cottage is home to two well-proportioned, neutrally decorated and two carpeted double bedrooms. The cottage has an electric heating system and the windows are partially double glazed.</p> <p>The home is accompanied by a generous, mature garden with a well-maintained lawn and a wealth of established trees and shrubs, as well as patios for outdoor seating, and the cottage has its own private garden with a paved area and a neatly kept lawn. The gardens also feature a number of sheds, wood stores, and a workshop. Excellent private parking is provided by a detached double garage and a driveway.</p> <p>Extras: All fitted floor coverings, window coverings, light fittings, and integrated kitchen appliances will be included in the sale. The freestanding kitchen appliances are available by separate negotiation, in addition to the furniture in the cottage.</p> <p>CAPUTH</p> <p>Caputh is a quaint village in the heart of the Perthshire countryside, on the banks of the River Tay, situated approximately five miles from Dunkeld, under eight miles from Blairgowrie and Rattray, and just over 13 miles from the heart of Perth. The historic village is home to a church which was built between the late 1700s and early 1800s, and it is also where the East Cult Standing Stones can be found. The village itself has a hall that can be booked for events and community groups, with the nearby village of Murthly also home to a hall that hosts various groups, shows, classes, and interest groups. A convenience store and a restaurant can also be found in Murthly, with more extensive shopping, leisure, and entertainment facilities available in the surrounding towns and villages, and of course in Perth. For those with children of school age, the property falls within the catchment area of Glendelvine Primary School, which is a short drive away and also walkable within 15 minutes, with secondary schooling provided at either Perth Grammar School or Blairgowrie High School. The surrounding countryside offers a picturesque backdrop for those who enjoy spending time in the great outdoors, with indoor fitness and leisure facilities found nearby if exercising inside is more your thing. Owing to the village&rsquo;s close proximity to good road links, travelling around the county and further a field by car is easy, whilst Dunkeld and Birnam train station is a short drive away.</p> <p>Generous, traditional detached house in Caputh<br>Attached self-contained two-bedroom cottage with multiple options for use<br>Elegant living room with warming fire<br>Spacious family room, also with a homely fire<br>Formal dining room, perfect for dinner parties<br>Versatile conservatory with garden access<br>Contemporary well-appointed breakfasting kitchen with pantry/utility and WC<br>4 Double Bedrooms, 2 En Suite Shower Rooms<br>Family bathroom with shower-over-bath<br>Air-source heating, solar panels & partial double glazing<br>Garden, Driveway, Double Garage, EPC - C&nbsp;</p></div>
