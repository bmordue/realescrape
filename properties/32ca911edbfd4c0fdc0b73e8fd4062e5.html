				<h2>North Mains Croft,<br>Logie DD8 5PG</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;425,000</h4>
<h3>Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">4</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>This beautiful four-bedroom detached house offers a picturesque semi-rural lifestyle amongst the open countryside by Kirriemuir, further boasting large rooms with neutral styling, extensive private parking, and a massive (approximately) 3-acre plot with amazing development potential.</p> <p>North Mains is a rarely available family home that features a wealth of accommodation, incorporating large reception rooms, a generously appointed dining kitchen, four double bedrooms, and four bathrooms. The detached house is well-presented throughout as well, enjoying light neutral interiors that are welcoming and homely. The surrounding plot ensures an equally impressive amount of outdoor space, with ample scope for extensions, a huge barn with development opportunity, and plenty of room for a separate dwelling (all subject to planning permissions). It also provides private parking for multiple vehicles. Set just on the outskirts of Kirriemuir, it is a scenic location for families promising all the beauty of the countryside with the convenience of the town&rsquo;s nearby amenities.</p> <p>Set amongst far-reaching countryside, North Mains has an inspiring approach that instils a sense of rural seclusion, whilst being mere minutes from the town of Kirriemuir. The home&rsquo;s enveloping plot adds to the effect, providing a tremendous amount of space for development. Stepping inside, you are greeted by an entrance porch flowing through to a dual-aspect cloakroom for coats and shoes.</p> <p>The two main reception rooms both have expansive footprints and T-shaped layouts, allowing a wide choice of furnishings and a variety of arrangements to suit your needs and lifestyle. Both rooms are neutrally decorated and brightly illuminated by dual-aspect windows. Both also feature a handsome fireplace inset with a cosy log-burning stove as well.</p> <p>The first reception room combines a living area and a study, whereas the second reception space is utilised as a sitting/formal dining room for family meals and entertaining. A southeast-facing sunroom provides another space for relaxing and socialising before flowing out into the surrounding garden.</p> <p>The dining kitchen has spacious dimensions to easily accommodate a table and chairs, alongside a generous range of cabinets and sweeping worksurfaces. It has easy-upkeep wooden floors and is further enhanced by the light decoration and neutral splashback tiles. It comes with an electric range cooker, a tall fridge, a tall freezer, and a dishwasher. A neighbouring utility room provides a quiet laundry setting and a wood-burning back boiler stove, which is connected to the central heating and hot water for added warmth and efficiency.</p> <p>The four bedrooms are all wonderfully large doubles that provide the homeowner with excellent space for a range of bedside furnishings. Each room maintains the attractive neutral d&eacute;cor and all are laid with soft carpets for underfoot comfort. The principal and second bedrooms also have the advantage of their own en-suite shower room for added luxury. There is also a floored attic (accessed via a drop-down ladder) that provides excellent storage.</p> <p>In addition to the two en-suites, the home boasts another spacious shower room at ground level (equipped with a double shower cubicle), as well as a first-floor family bathroom fitted with a four-piece suite. The bathroom is comprised of a toilet, a washbasin, a bidet, and a bathtub.</p> <p>The property has oil-fired central heating and double-glazed windows throughout. Solar roof panels to the southeast-facing front bring further efficiency.</p> <p>Externally, the home sits within a roughly 3-acre plot which is laid to lawn and enclosed by mature trees. It provides ample wraparound garden space that captures all-day sun whilst offering excellent privacy and room for growing fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the substantial amount of space available grants the owner with outstanding scope for development, including home extensions and a separate dwelling (subject to consent), creating exciting avenues to explore. A huge barn/workshop/store is included, along with another generous workshop providing storage and ample scope for creative use. A shed and a summerhouse are included as well. In addition, the home has a private driveway with parking for several vehicles, alongside a wooden garage and the surrounding plot that can easily accommodate further cars if needed.</p> <p>Extras: all fitted floor and window coverings, light fittings, an electric range cooker, a tall fridge, a tall freezer, and a dishwasher to be included in the sale.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Kirriemuir</p> <p>The charming town of Kirriemuir, known locally as Kirrie, is the &ldquo;Gateway to the Glens&rdquo; and lies just under six miles from Angus&rsquo; county town of Forfar. Kirriemuir is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Sir JM Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, whose childhood home in the town is now a museum. There is a statue of Peter Pan in the middle of the town, and Barrie gifted a camera obscura to the people of the town, along with the cricket pavilion in which it is housed, which is a popular tourist attraction, from which panoramic views of the surrounding countryside can be enjoyed. The town is home to excellent amenities, including a supermarket, a minimarket, a number of independent retailers, a bakery, a butcher&rsquo;s shop, a Post Office, caf&eacute;s, coffee shops, bars, a restaurant, and takeaways, as well as hairdressers, a barber, and beauty salons. More extensive shopping facilities, including high street stores and ASDA and Tesco Superstores, can be found in nearby Forfar. Kirriemuir hosts an annual traditional music festival and the town hall offers events throughout the year such as plays and concerts, whilst the town also enjoys a number of community and sports groups, and a sports centre with a swimming pool and gym. For those who prefer spending time outdoors, Kirriemuir has a number of parks and its own golf course, with no shortage of walking, cycling and running routes in the surrounding countryside. Schooling is well catered for in the town, with two primary schools (Northmuir and Southmuir) and a secondary school, Webster&rsquo;s High School. Kirriemuir is well connected to the rest of the county and further afield, owing to excellent bus and road links.</p> <ul> <li>Large detached house with a roughly 3-acre plot</li> <li>Outstanding scope for further development&nbsp;</li> <li>Picturesque semi-rural setting by Kirriemuir&nbsp;</li> <li>Enveloped by far-reaching countryside&nbsp;</li> <li>Attractive neutral decoration throughout</li> <li>Entrance porch and dual-aspect cloakroom</li> <li>Expansive living room/study with a log burner</li> <li>Large sitting/formal dining room with a log burner</li> <li>Sunroom with southeast-facing aspect</li> <li>Generously appointed dining kitchen&nbsp;</li> <li>Utility room with wood-burning back boiler stove</li> <li>Four large and airy double bedrooms&nbsp;</li> <li>Two quality 3pc en-suite shower rooms&nbsp;</li> <li>Spacious 3pc shower room at ground level</li> <li>First-floor family bathroom with a 4pc suite</li> <li>Floored attic providing further storage&nbsp;</li> <li>Oil-fired central heating and double glazing&nbsp;</li> <li>Solar roof panels to the southeast-facing front</li> <li>3-acre plot that is laid to lawn and framed by trees</li> <li>Huge barn/workshop/store and a second workshop</li> <li>Shed for further storage and a summerhouse</li> <li>Driveway for several vehicles and a wooden garage&nbsp;</li> </ul></div>
