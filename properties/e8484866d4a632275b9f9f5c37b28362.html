The home is beautifully presented and boasts a wealth of flexible living areas, as well as large, well-maintained gardens and a multi-car driveway. Despite the property&rsquo;s quiet location, it lies just a 15-minute drive from Dundee City Centre, making it an ideal choice for commuters and ensuring outstanding facilities and amenities are within easy reach &ndash; the true definition of &ldquo;the best of both worlds&rdquo;!</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; Welcoming you into Miltonhaugh</p> <p>The front door opens into a practical entrance vestibule, flowing through to an inviting hall with space for furniture items. Here, the first glimpse of the home&rsquo;s tasteful interiors is given, with attractive blue d&eacute;cor, accent wallpaper, and a fitted carpet for optimum comfort underfoot.</p> <p>Reception rooms &ndash; Multiple living areas for everyday life and entertaining guests</p> <p>The house accommodates a living room, a formal dining room, a family room, and a sunroom, all offering fantastic flexibility for use and perfect for large families and sociable gatherings.&nbsp;</p> <p>The wonderfully bright and generous living room is decorated in warm, cheerful yellow and carpeted for comfort, and it features a characterful fireplace (with a warming open fire) around which furniture can be arranged. The equally spacious dining room is across the hall and creates the ideal setting for family meals and dinner parties &ndash; perfect for those who love to host! The room can easily accommodate a large dining table and chairs in addition to other furniture, and it is connected to a sunroom. The sunroom allows for year-round enjoyment of the garden, with a wealth of glazing flooding the space with natural light and French doors opening outside. The final reception area, a family room, is illuminated by triple-aspect windows framing leafy garden views. It offers a more informal area to relax as a family and would also be a great space for use as a children&rsquo;s playroom or a teenager&rsquo;s den.</p> <p>Kitchen/dining room &ndash; Stylishly appointed cooking zone with sociable dining area</p> <p>The large open-plan dining kitchen is sure to be a sociable hub within this fabulous family home, with ample space to comfortably accommodate an eight-seater table (with potential for a large one if desired) alongside additional furniture &ndash; perfect for casual family meals, morning coffee, and socialising while cooking. The kitchen is very well-appointed with a wide range of contemporary, gloss-grey wall and base cabinets, spacious worktops, and splashback panels, with integrated appliances complementing the sleek, modern finish. These include a double oven, an induction hob, an extractor hood, a fridge/freezer, and a dishwasher.</p> <p>A separate utility room (approached via a rear vestibule with access to the sheltered back patio area) supplements the kitchen, housing additional cabinets, worktops, and space for laundry appliances.</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Four comfortable sleeping areas</p> <p>The bedrooms are all on the first floor, approached via a staircase and landing with built-in storage and a snug area set beneath a skylight window &ndash; a perfect reading nook! Three of the bedrooms are all accompanied by large built-in wardrobes with sliding doors, including the principal, which also benefits from its own en-suite shower room. The fourth bedroom is currently being utilised as a home office, highlighting the home&rsquo;s versatility and ideal for homeworking and studying.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; Three well-appointed washrooms, ideal for family life</p> <p>The principal bedroom&rsquo;s en-suite shower room comprises a corner shower enclosure, a traditionally styled WC-suite, and a chrome towel radiator, whilst the additional ground-floor shower room also has a corner cubicle, a pedestal basin, and a WC. Finally, the four-piece family bathroom comes complete with a bathtub, a separate shower enclosure, a WC-suite, and a towel radiator.</p> <p>Oil central heating and double glazing ensure year-round comfort and efficiency.</p> <p>Gardens & parking &ndash; Beautifully maintained outdoor space and equestrian facilities</p> <p>The house is set on a generous plot extending to approximately 3.2 acres, including spacious, well-maintained gardens and a paddock, as well as a barn suitable for conversion to stables. The gardens wrap around the property to the front, sides, and rear and feature expansive, manicured lawns, leafy shrubs, neat hedgerows, and a number of mature trees. A sheltered patio to the back offers a perfect alfresco dining and barbecue area. Excellent off-street parking is provided by a large, multi-car driveway.</p> <p>Extras: blinds, light fittings, integrated appliances and fitted floor coverings are included in the sale</p> <p>Tealing</p> <p>Nestled at the foot of the Sidlaw Hills and surrounded by open countryside, the peaceful village of Tealing offers a sought-after rural lifestyle with the added benefit of being only 15 minutes by car from the city of Dundee. Offering an abundance of country walks and outdoor pursuits on your doorstep, Tealing caters to both relaxed and active lifestyles. Village life is centred on the village hall, with several working farms in the nearby area, including a farm and coffee shop, which offers fresh local produce, delicious food, and a garden nursery. Furthermore, the area has a rich history, evident at Tealing Earth House, a historic Iron-age underground passage. Nursery and primary schooling are provided locally with desirable small class sizes, whilst secondary and further education are on offer in nearby Dundee.</p> <p>Just a short drive or bus journey away, Scotland&rsquo;s fourth largest city, Dundee, provides all your everyday amenities, supermarkets, and a wide variety of shopping facilities. Recently voted by the Sunday Times as one of the top twelve places to live in Britain, Dundee is brimming with culture, boasting a regenerated waterfront with two nautical museums (RRS Discovery, Captain Scott&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition ship, and the 19th-century warship, HM Frigate Unicorn) and the architectural triumph of the newly opened V & A Dundee, Scotland&rsquo;s first design museum. Further museums, arts centres, and theatres can be found across the city, along with a vibrant array of bars and restaurants. Major road and rail links connect Dundee to the rest of Scotland and further afield, whilst Dundee airport also offers regular flights to London City Airport.</p></div>
