<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>Exceptional B-listed Arts and Crafts house in Dundee, dating back to 1912 and boasting wonderfully spacious and flexible accommodation, including five bedrooms, three reception rooms, an open-plan breakfasting kitchen and dining room, and three bathrooms (plus a separate WC), as well as delightful, generous gardens and ample private parking.</p> <p>This unique and rarely available five-bedroom, three-bathroom B-listed Arts and Crafts house enjoys an excellent location on an exclusive street in Dundee. Boasting exceptionally spacious and flexible accommodation, the home is beautifully presented with attractive interiors, with classically styled, timeless fixtures and fittings and a wealth of period features. The house occupies a plot of approximately 0.67 acres, with generous, delightful gardens, a detached double garage, and a vast private driveway. Dundee&rsquo;s outstanding amenities are all easily accessible from the home, such as a wide range of shops, including major supermarkets, high-street stores, and independent retailers, education facilities in the private and state sector ranging from nursery to university levels, transport links (including a train station and the airport), and a wealth of green space.</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; An impressive introduction to a magnificent home</p> <p>Approached via a winding pathway through the front garden, offering a fitting introduction to an outstanding home, the front door opens into a practical entrance vestibule, leading through to a reception hall with storage and a cloakroom WC. Here, the tone for the interiors is immediately set with a wealth of period features, and the hall offers space for a cosy seating area set in front of a fireplace with a multi-fuel stove, as well as a charming window seat.</p> <p>Reception rooms &ndash; Three large living areas filled with period charm</p> <p>The house boasts three wonderfully bright and spacious, impressive reception areas, sure to be perfect for everyday family life and a dream for those who love to host and entertain. All three rooms are enviably south-facing, enjoying fabulous sunshine throughout the day and enjoying peaceful leafy views.</p> <p>The sitting and drawing rooms echo each other in terms of airy proportions, with the drawing room boasting a slightly larger footprint, both offering ample space for endless configurations of furniture. The rooms both also have large feature bay windows.</p> <p>The dining room, which also has traditional cornicing, presents the perfect setting for sit-down meals and formal entertaining, with more than enough space for at least an eight-seater table alongside additional furniture.</p> <p>The sitting room is perfect for relaxing as a family in the evening, with the drawing room offering a more formal space for gatherings. Both have elegant cornicing and stunning fireplaces, with the drawing room further enjoying a beautiful ceiling rose, warm wood flooring, and an adjoining bar area.</p> <p>Breakfasting kitchen and dining room &ndash; Timeless and well-equipped kitchen with space for dining</p> <p>The kitchen, by renowned Scottish kitchen designer, David Douglas, boasts a timeless design, with hand painted, cream-coloured solid wood cabinets accompanied by gleaming granite worktops and a double Belfast sink. A colour-coordinating six-burner, four-oven Aga stove is nestled neatly within the cabinets, whilst integrated Miele appliances comprise a double oven, a steam oven, a combination microwave, a coffee machine, a warming drawer, a fridge, a freezer, and a dishwasher. A breakfast bar caters for morning coffee and socialising while cooking, and the kitchen is adjoined by a casual dining area, ideal for everyday family meals. The kitchen is also supplemented by a walk-in larder cupboard and two separate utility rooms &ndash; one with a wealth of cabinetry, workspace, and an integrated fridge, and the other with cabinets, a clothes pulley, and laundry appliances.</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Five large and peaceful bedrooms for a restful night&rsquo;s sleep</p> <p>On the first floor, a long landing (with a useful study area/reading nook) leads to the home&rsquo;s five bedrooms and a home office, the latter providing an ideal quiet space for those who study or work from home. The impressive principal bedroom spans a generous footprint and is accompanied by a large dressing room with a wealth of fitted wardrobes, offering a truly luxurious touch, as well as an en-suite shower room. The remaining four bedrooms are all also generously proportioned and could lend themselves to a variety of uses, with one supplemented by built-in storage.</p> <p>Attic room &ndash; Fabulous games room with endless opportunities for use</p> <p>The large attic room is a fantastic, versatile space that is currently set up as a games room &ndash; perfect for a teenager&rsquo;s den, or as a bedroom/living space for older children, live-in relatives, or guests.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; Three well-appointed washrooms, perfect for family life</p> <p>The principal bedroom&rsquo;s en-suite features a corner shower enclosure, a WC-suite, and a towel radiator, whilst a separate shower room comprises a walk-in cubicle with a rainfall showerhead, a WC-suite, and linen storage. Finally, a family bathroom completes the accommodation on offer and comes replete with a bath with an overhead shower and a traditionally styled WC-suite.</p> <p>The home is kept warm by a gas central heating system.</p> <p>Gardens and parking &ndash; Beautiful, generous gardens and extensive private parking</p> <p>The home is perfectly complemented by suitably impressive outdoor space, with the delightful gardens offering a haven in which to relax and enjoy the warmer weather during the summer months. The gardens feature expansive, well-maintained lawns, a wealth of established, leafy trees and shrubs, and a large, tranquil paved area for outdoor dining furniture and a summerhouse. To the back of the house you will find a charming courtyard area, leading to the multi-car driveway and a detached double garage.</p> <p>Extras: All fitted floor coverings, window coverings, light fittings, integrated kitchen appliances, washing machine, dryer, and an American-style fridge/freezer, as well as the attic TV and bar electric heater will be included in the sale. Some furniture is available by separate negotiation.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Dundee</p> <p>Scotland&rsquo;s fourth largest and notably sunniest city, Dundee lies on the east coast, on the Firth of Tay estuary, and was recently voted by the Sunday Times as one of the top twelve places to live in Britain. A historic port and now a UNESCO City of Design, Dundee is brimming with culture; boasting a regenerated waterfront with two nautical museums (RRS Discovery, Captain Scott&rsquo;s Antarctic expedition ship, and the 19th-century warship, HM Frigate Unicorn) and the architectural triumph of the newly opened V & A Dundee, Scotland&rsquo;s first design museum. Further museums, arts centres and theatres can be found across the city, along with a vibrant array of bars and restaurants. There are also various restaurants offering a multitude of cuisines just a mile away from the home. A wildlife centre, cinemas and excellent sports and leisure facilities are also on offer. Largely walk-able, Dundee provides a delightful and convenient shopping experience, hosting a wide selection of high-street retail outlets, shopping centres (one with a large public library) and supermarkets. The city provides education at all levels, with private and state institutions and one of the UK&rsquo;s leading universities, as well as a teaching hospital. Major road and rail links connect Dundee to the rest of Scotland and further afield, whilst Dundee airport also offers flights to London City Airport.</p> <ul> <li>B-listed, detached Arts and Crafts house in Dundee&nbsp;</li> <li>Situated on an exclusive, leafy street&nbsp;</li> <li>Beautifully presented interiors and period features&nbsp;</li> <li>Entrance vestibule and grand reception hall&nbsp;</li> <li>Sitting room with south-facing bay window&nbsp;</li> <li>Generous formal dining room&nbsp;</li> <li>Impressive drawing room with south-facing bay window and bar&nbsp;</li> <li>Timeless breakfasting kitchen with dining area, larder, and two utility rooms&nbsp;</li> <li>Principal bedroom with large dressing room and en-suite shower room&nbsp;</li> <li>Four further double bedrooms&nbsp;</li> <li>Shower room and separate family bathroom&nbsp;</li> <li>Gas central heating system</li> <li>Delightful, generous and mature garden grounds&nbsp;</li> <li>Detached double garage and multi-car driveway&nbsp;</li> </ul></div>
