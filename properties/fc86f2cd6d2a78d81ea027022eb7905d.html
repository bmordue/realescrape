<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>The Bowmore is a magnificent 5-bedroom detached home built by Springfield. Boasting an impressive 2000 square feet, excluding the integrated double garage, this stunning residence offers a luxurious living standard that caters to the needs and desires of even the largest families. From its beautiful features to its thoughtful design, every aspect of the Bowmore will leave you feeling like you're living in a dream.</p> <p>As you approach the Bowmore, its grand presence captivates you from the street. The protruding gable exudes authority, while the use of grey feature brick adds texture and tone, softening the overall appearance to give the cosy feeling of a family home. Above the double garage doors, a Juliet balcony from the main bedroom becomes a captivating focal point that draws your eye. The abundance of windows creates a light-filled and joyous ambiance, providing a warm and welcoming feel to your new home. Moreover, these strategically placed windows offer both natural light and privacy for you and your family.</p> <p>Upon arrival, you're greeted by a driveway finished with monobloc paving. The front garden, beautifully turfed, completes the polished look of your home. Even the smallest details have been taken care of, including a doorbell and motion sensor light, ensuring convenience and security.</p> <p>Stepping inside, you're immediately enveloped in the spaciousness of the Bowmore. The large hallway, spanning through the centre of the building, grants access to all ground floor rooms as well as the upper level. To one side, you'll find the integrated double garage, providing ample space for your vehicles and storage needs.</p> <p>Straight ahead, a versatile room awaits, perfect for your specific requirements. Whether you need a fifth bedroom, an ideal guest room, a study, a play area, or even a whisky room, the Bowmore offers the flexibility to make it work for you. This ground floor space ensures convenience for those with disabilities or elderly family members, offering a comfortable and accessible option.</p> <p>Moving onward, the lounge beckons you with its two floor-to-ceiling windows, offering captivating views in different directions. Here, your TV and broadband points are already installed, ready for you to connect and enjoy your favourite shows. In every room of the Bowmore, you have the opportunity to choose your paint colours, allowing you to infuse your personal style and preferences throughout your new home.</p> <p>The heart of the Bowmore lies in its open plan kitchen and dining area, where French doors open up to your garden. The dining area, a beautiful open space, provides ample room for large gatherings and entertaining guests, while also serving as a casual family hub.</p> <p>The kitchen boasts an extensive range of integrated appliances tucked behind your choice of cabinets, including an oven, hob, hood, microwave, dishwasher, and fridge freezer. You have the freedom to customize your kitchen with a selection of worktops, cabinets, and even door handles, ensuring a personalised touch. With plenty of usable worktop space and thoughtful storage solutions, this well-designed kitchen facilitates ease and efficiency in your daily routines. The layout has been thoughtfully considered with the sink under the window looking out to the garden, and the hob and oven taking centre stage on the back wall. Additionally, the breakfast bar area can double as an ideal homework station for the kids, making it a versatile and functional addition to your home. This area creates a nice distinction between the kitchen and dining spaces.</p> <p>To further enhance the tidiness and organization of your kitchen, a utility room is conveniently located off the kitchen, featuring additional worktop space and ample room for a washing machine.</p> <p>Completing the ground floor is a well-appointed downstairs W.C., adorned with your choice of half-height tiling around all walls. The large under stairs storage cupboard allows you to tuck away all your belongings, keeping your home looking fresh and uncluttered.</p> <p>Prepare to be amazed as you ascend the staircase to the upper level of the Bowmore. Many of the &lsquo;wow factor&rsquo; highlights of this extraordinary home await you in bedroom 1. Boasting exceptional space, this bedroom offers a sanctuary that is architecturally captivating and an enjoyable space to spend time and unwind. The sloped ceilings on each side add a touch of intricacy, perfectly balancing the vastness of the room. To one side, three Velux windows integrated into the sloped ceiling flood the room with natural light, while on the other side, a Juliet balcony beckons you to embrace the surrounding vistas.</p> <p>Equipped with a well-appointed en-suite, complete with a bathtub and shower cubicle, this room exudes elegance and luxury. The en-suite is flooded with natural light, courtesy of another Velux window, and features full-height tiling around the bath and shower areas, complemented by a chrome trim for a professional finish. With a wide range of tiles and vanity units to choose from, you have the freedom to make this en-suite a reflection of your personal taste. Finishing touches such as a heated towel warmer, a large wall mirror, and a shaver socket ensure you have a practical space to enjoy. And before we leave bedroom 1, there is one final talking point &mdash; it also boasts a walk-in wardrobe and an additional storage cupboard, offering abundant space to organize and display your extensive collection of clothes, accessories, suits and more. There&rsquo;s room to store it all in a way that makes it easy to find what you&rsquo;re looking for and put together outfits.</p> <p>The remaining bedrooms in the Bowmore are equally impressive, each providing an all-inclusive experience. Bedroom 2, situated at the rear of the home with views of the garden, offers an en-suite with a shower cubicle and a fitted wardrobe. Bedrooms 3 and 4 also feature fitted wardrobes and are generously sized, providing comfortable and stylish spaces for family members or guests. To add a touch of individuality, a range of wardrobe door choices are available. And finishing the upper floor is a family bathroom, with a shower over the bathtub, located centrally off the upper hallway providing easy access for everyone.</p> <p>Stepping through the French doors in the dining room, you are welcomed into your garden. With turf already in place, you can enjoy the refreshing green space from day one. The 1.8m high fence that surrounds the entire garden ensures your privacy, creating an environment where you and your family can feel at ease. A garden tap is included, so you can water your plants, hose away muddy dog paws or fill up the swimming pool in the summer. This space is the perfect setting for you and your family to create lasting memories and embrace the good weather.</p> <p>At Springfield, we understand the importance of using only the highest quality materials and finishes in your new home.
