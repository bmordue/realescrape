				<h2>85 Patrick Allan-Fraser Street,<br>Arbroath DD11 2LX</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;250,000</h4>
<h3>Semi-Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">4</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>Boasting exceptionally stylish and contemporary interiors over two floors, this spacious four-bedroom house in Arbroath enjoys large living areas, designed to make the most of an indoor-outdoor lifestyle.</p> <p>Set within walking distance of the primary school, shops, and coastline, this home is ideal for a modern family looking for a turn-key home and lifestyle. Having been extensively renovated and modernised in the past two years by its current owners, 85 Patrick Allan-Fraser Street offers its new owners flexible accommodation, with multiple reception rooms bolstered by private landscaped gardens, as well as extensive private parking.</p> <p>Located in a cul-de-sac, circling a communal green with mature trees, the property is set behind a low wall and front garden, accessed from the private drive and walkway. The contemporary front door offers the first glimpse of the modernised interiors to follow, leading to a vestibule, which in turn gives access to central L-shaped hall (with stairs leading to the first floor), delivering on the promise of tasteful family living.</p> <p>The Living Room - a spacious and sunny retreat</p> <p>From its oversized wall-to-wall window, with rear garden views and a southerly aspect, the living room bathes in natural light. This spacious reception room is arranged around a focal inset fire and a wall-mounted TV - enhancing the crisp, modern aesthetic of the room.</p> <p>The kitchen and dining room - the heart of this home</p> <p>Also enjoying a sunny, southerly aspect with a door leading directly to the decked terrace and garden, as well as double doors to the conservatory, the open-plan kitchen and dining room, is truly the heart of this home.</p> <p>The ultra-contemporary kitchen, with its sleek and handleless white fa&ccedil;ade, neatly conceals a range of integrated appliances including: a fridge, a freezer, a slimline wine cooler, a dishwasher, an electric oven, an induction hob, and an extractor fan, with undercounter space for a washing machine to neatly slot in. The expansive white worktops are framed by metro-style tiling and lit by undercounter lights - ensuring that this kitchen delivers on both form and function.</p> <p>The dining area, set away from the rest of the kitchen, is ideal for both entertaining and family meals. With its bold wallpaper, warm earthy toned walls and soft material textures, this simply sumptuous space can easily seat 6-diners, while double partly glazed, doors give access to yet another reception room....</p> <p>The conservatory - a room to enjoy the outdoors all year round</p> <p>The last of the living spaces is the conservatory, reached from the dining area through double doors. This versatile space comes with triple-aspect windows, central heating, and patio doors leading to the garden, making this versatile space ideal for either another seating area, hobby or playroom. Bathing in warm sunshine throughout the day, with lovely garden views, it is the ideal space to enjoy the gardens all year round.</p> <p>The sleeping quarters - arranged over two floors</p> <p>Two of the four bedrooms are located on the ground floor both serviced by a modern shower room. The crisp finishes and hard floors of these spacious rooms, also give them the flexibility for alternative uses, should all four bedrooms not be required by the new owners. The bedrooms continue the theme of spaciousness found throughout the house, with a footprint large enough for bedroom furniture, as well as seating, or desk space, if required.</p> <p>The principal bedroom is located on the first floor, where its south-facing window offers delightful, leafy views over the neighbouring rooftops. Also located on the first floor is the fourth double bedroom (also south-facing), and a modern shower room. Three of the four bedrooms come with integrated storage space, with one of them currently utilised as a home office.</p> <p>The outdoors and parking - private spaces ideal for family life</p> <p>At the front of the property is a low-maintenance garden, with paved pathways and a generous private drive, leading to a single garage. The property boasts an electric car (EV) charger, and through a wooden gate (separating the front and rear gardens), the side garden is also home to a greenhouse and a shed.</p> <p>The fully enclosed and landscaped rear garden, with its sunny southerly aspect, is designed for weekend barbecues, sundowners, and a safe space for both children and pets to play. The fabulous decked terrace, set under a large pergola with a retractable awning, is made from quality maintenance-free composite decking. The rest of the garden comes with an area of lawn, hedges, and flowerbeds.</p> <p>Other information</p> <p>The house enjoys double glazing and gas central heating throughout (with parts of the ground floor fitted with attractive, contemporary vertical radiators) ensuring a warm yet cost-effective living environment all year round. Included in the sale are: all the integrated kitchen appliances, window and floor coverings, light fittings, EV Charger, greenhouse and shed.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Arbroath, Angus</p> <p>The town of Arbroath offers an idyllic coastal lifestyle, surrounded by unspoilt scenery with a picturesque working harbour, sandy beaches, historic architecture, and a bustling town centre. Home to the famous Arbroath Abbey, the Bell Rock Lighthouse (Britain&rsquo;s oldest offshore lighthouse), and Arbroath smokies, the town offers a seamless blend between history, nature, culture, and modern living.
