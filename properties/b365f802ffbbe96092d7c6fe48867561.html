				<h2>Hurly Hawkins, Gray Den,<br>Liff DD2 5LT</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;575,000</h4>
<h3>Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">3</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>With a large plot of land, this three-bedroom architecturally-designed detached house is an outstanding residence set amongst open countryside, providing a sought-after rural lifestyle in the peaceful village of Liff, which is just a short and convenient drive from the city of Dundee.</p>  <p>Set amongst open countryside and framed by mature trees, Hurly Hawkin is a detached house that enjoys a secluded and highly scenic location in picturesque Liff village. The three-bedroom family home is a rarely available property, which combines the best of countryside living with a major city practically on the doorstep. Designed to maximise the interplay of space and light, it boasts a quality kitchen and two shower rooms, and multiple reception rooms (many with dual-aspect windows and teak parquet hardwood floors). Plus,&nbsp;the residence has ample private parking and a large plot, incorporating landscaped wraparound gardens and mature woodlands.</p>  <p>The home was also fully re-roofed with sarking and lining, and slated with heavy grade Spanish slates in May 2012. The property has a beautiful approach, brimming with country charm. Inside, a naturally-lit vestibule and a hall with a cloak cupboard provide a wonderful introduction, setting the standards of this impressive family home.</p>  <p>Hurly Hawkin has multiple reception rooms to enjoy. For daily use, there is a large living room, decorated in soothing neutral hues and laid with a teak parquet hardwood floor (also found in the hall and formal dining room). Elegant and inviting, it further benefits from oversized windows and a dual-fuel stove (inset into a stone surround) which has a 5kW output and a large capacity back boiler with an output in excess of 50,000 BTUs. In addition, the room openly adjoins to a dual-aspect formal dining room that is well suited to special occasions. And for admiring the scenic garden views (whatever the weather), there is also a sunroom and a spacious garden room. Both enjoy inspiring leafy outlooks and dual-aspect, full-height windows for a light-filled ambience. The two spaces extend out onto their own private patio for summer socialising. Furthermore, the garden room could easily be altered to be a fourth bedroom incorporating en suite facilities (subject to consent).</p>  <p>The dining kitchen has generous proportions and an open-plan kitchen adjacent, creating the perfect setup for family meals and lively dinner parties. It has dual-aspect windows and extends out into the rear garden for summer soirees. Furthermore, the entire space has ample storage for cooking equipment, with a wealth of base and wall-mounted cabinets, as well as sweeping worksurfaces (which are downlit in the kitchen galley). Appliances include: a gas range cooker, an integrated fridge/freezer, an integrated washing machine, and an undercounter dishwasher.</p>  <p>The three bedrooms are all bright and airy doubles, which are finished in neutral hues and with fitted carpets for optimal comfort. Each room is also supported by a built-in wardrobe to maximise the useable floorspace. The principal bedroom has the largest footprint and a handy washbasin, whilst the second bedroom showcases the versatility of the property, being arranged as an office.</p>  <p>The home is served by a modern three-piece shower room and a high-specification four-piece shower room, which is comprised of a toilet, a bidet, a towel radiator, a floating washbasin, an illuminated mirror, and a double walk-in shower enclosure.</p>  <p>Hurly Hawkin comes with an incredible 5-acre plot, which includes stunning wraparound gardens that are very well stocked with trees, shrubs, and perennials, having been carefully landscaped with the entire family in mind. The gardens are expansive, incorporating a flowing pond, sweeping manicured lawns (one of which is arranged to host a marquee), and large patios framed by established planting and mature trees. They offer picture-postcard views and endless outdoor enjoyment. In addition, there are two summerhouses (one is rotatable), a gardener&#39;s shed (with an electric light), floodlighting in select areas, a vibrant woodland to explore, and a historic 12th-century (circa) broch that is allegedly the palace of King Alexander I of Scotland. With so much land at your disposal, the opportunities are boundless. Unrivalled private parking is also provided via a large, gated driveway and two garages with an integrated carport and electricity.</p>  <p>Extras: all fitted carpets, curtains and blinds, light fittings (except the wall lights in the living room), a stove, a gas range cooker, and all white goods in the kitchen are included in the sale price.</p>  <p>The charming village of Liff has a picturesque setting amidst the rolling Angus countryside, just six miles west of Dundee city centre. It is an exclusive area that promises the best of both worlds, providing an idyllic rural escape for families and an easy commute for city professionals, being within swift reach of Dundee and Perth. Whilst there are shops and amenities found in the nearby villages of Longforgan, Invergowrie and Birkhill, Dundee is also just a short drive away, offering a wealth of shopping and cultural facilities. The city is home to all your daily needs, including independent retailers, large supermarkets, a vibrant culinary scene, and fabulous sports and leisure facilities. Furthermore, the countryside that surrounds Liff stretches as far as the eye can see, brimming with activities for outdoor enthusiasts. There are two excellent golf courses close by as well, with challenging greens and fairways at Piperdam Golf Course and Downfield Golf Club. Fishing can be enjoyed on the River Tay, and a number of shoots are available in the Carse of Gowrie. And of course, there are a wealth of scenic walks and biking routes available from one&#39;s own front door. An established centre of educational excellence, Dundee has renowned university options and it is home to the highly-regarded independent High School of Dundee. Liff village also has its own primary school. For easy travel, the area is well-connected by railway stations at nearby Invergowrie and Dundee; plus, major road and rail links connect Dundee to the rest of Scotland and further afield, whilst Dundee Airport offers regular flights to London.</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Outstanding detached house in Liff village</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Secluded and highly scenic countryside location</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Just a 15-minute drive from Dundee city centre</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Light neutral interior d&eacute;cor throughout</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Bright vestibule and hall with storage</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Living room with a dual-fuel stove</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Well-proportioned formal dining room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect sunroom with garden access</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect garden room with leafy views</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Large dining kitchen and open-plan kitchen</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Three double bedrooms with wardrobes</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Modern three-piece shower room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;High-spec four-piece shower room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Gas central heating and double glazing</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Bright vestibule and hall with storage</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Living room with a dual-fuel stove</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Well-proportioned formal dining room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect sunroom with garden access</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Dual-aspect garden room with leafy views</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Large dining kitchen and open-plan kitchen</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Three double bedrooms with wardrobes</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Modern three-piece shower room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;High-spec four-piece shower room</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Gas central heating and double glazing</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Large plot, including mature woodlands</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Stunning landscaped wraparound gardens</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Gardener&rsquo;s shed with an electric light</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Two garages with integrated carport</p>  <p>&bull; &nbsp;Multi-car driveway for two dozen cars</p> </div>
