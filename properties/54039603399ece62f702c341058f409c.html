				<h2>Viewfield,<br>Eassie DD8 1SR</h2>
<h4>Offers Over &pound;355,000</h4>
<h3>Detached House</h3>
<p><span class="large_character">5</span> Bedrooms</p>
<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>Welcome to Viewfield: a stunning five/six-bedroom detached house that offers a wealth of interior and exterior space, as well as a picturesque rural lifestyle in the exclusive village of Balkeerie.</p> <p>Covering 2634 square feet, this detached house is a substantial family home that goes above and beyond expectations to offer large families exceptional living standards. It features two reception rooms, a high-end breakfasting kitchen, five/six double bedrooms, and three premium en-suites and a four-piece family bathroom &ndash; all finished to a high specification and with attractive interior design. The southeast-facing residence further benefits from generous private parking and family-friendly gardens that are carefully maintained. Situated in Balkeerie village amongst the open countryside, three miles from Eassie, 0.4 miles from Eassie School, a desirable school within the area and 0.3 miles to the Eassie & Nevay Hall, which is a designated Angus Council Community Resilience Centre. It enjoys spectacular panoramic views and a rural sense of seclusion, yet the home is just 25 minutes&rsquo; drive from Dundee city centre and only 14 minutes from Forfar. It is the perfect balance of country living and convenience &ndash; a wonderful combination for families.</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; An impeccable welcome</p> <p>Inside Viewfield, you are greeted by a vestibule flowing into a reception hall with two built-in cupboards. It is an impeccable welcome heightened by the crisp white d&eacute;cor and wood-style floor (found throughout much of the home).</p> <p>Reception rooms &ndash; A haven of comfort</p> <p>The living room is a haven of comfort, with its expansive footprint accommodating a wide choice of furnishings. It continues the hall&rsquo;s neutral d&eacute;cor and wood-textured floor for a minimalist-inspired style that is instantly inviting. A modern log-burning stove adds a cosy focal point to the space, whilst a box bay window captures lots of natural light and uninterrupted views over the countryside to rolling hills.</p> <p>Double doors lead from here into a spacious dining room, creating the ideal setup for entertaining family and friends. This additional reception space is perfect for dinner parties, and, for summer barbecues, it extends out into the rear garden via French doors. Enjoying a chic aesthetic, it is decorated in a striking blue tone and with feature accent wallpaper, enhancing a lively atmosphere.</p> <p>Kitchen &ndash; A beautiful kitchen with a central island</p> <p>Arranged around a central island that doubles as a breakfast bar, the dual-aspect kitchen has a beautiful design that is generously appointed. It has a wealth of Shaker-style cabinets in white topped with chunky wood-toned worktops which add a lovely contrast to the colour palette. There is direct access to the driveway and a selection of appliances are also included (electric range cooker, American-style fridge/freezer, microwave, integrated dishwasher, and integrated washing machine).</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Lots of versatile space and luxurious features</p> <p>Located throughout the home, the five double bedrooms continue the high standards, providing lots of versatile space and luxurious features. On the first floor, the large principal and second bedrooms both have their own walk-in wardrobes and en-suite shower rooms, ensuring the very best. They also enjoy inspiring country panoramas from their elevated position as well. Bedroom five (a good-size double) is set between them. On the ground floor, bedrooms three and four are spacious doubles with built-in wardrobes. The former also has its own en-suite shower room and French doors flowing out into the rear garden. Furthermore, there is a versatile study/sitting room that provides a quiet setting for working from home or an additional reception area. It also offers the flexibility to be used as a sixth double bedroom if required.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; Three en-suites and a luxurious family bathroom</p> <p>Along with the three contemporary en-suite shower rooms, the home has an opulent family bathroom located on the ground floor. It is fitted with a high-spec four-piece suite, featuring a toilet, a washbasin with generous storage, a shower enclosure with handheld and overhead rainfall showers, and a large whirlpool corner bathtub offering a spa-like experience.</p> <p>For optimal comfort and efficiency, the property has LPG gas central heating, double-glazed windows, and a solar-panelled roof to the southeast-facing front.</p> <p>Garden & Parking &ndash; Lots of outdoor space for summer enjoyment</p> <p>Externally, Viewfield is flanked by front and rear gardens that are both fully enclosed for the safety of families. The front garden is mostly laid to lawn and with a southeast-facing aspect. Meanwhile, the sunny rear garden features a generous stretch of lawn and an accompanying patio, offering lots of space for playing children and for summer dining. It has excellent privacy and far-reaching countryside views &ndash; an inspiring backdrop all year round. It also comes with two large sheds. Furthermore, a side driveway easily provides private parking for several vehicles.</p> <p>Extras: all fitted floor and window coverings, light fittings, integrated kitchen appliances, an electric range cooker, a fridge/freezer, and a microwave to be included in the sale.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Eassie, Forfar</p> <p>Nestled in the scenic valley of Strathmore, the small village of Eassie offers a tranquil lifestyle set amongst the picturesque Angus countryside. Just off the A94 and a ten minutes&rsquo; drive from Forfar, the area enjoys a peaceful rural ambience while remaining well-connected to nearby towns and cities, ensuring easy access to modern amenities. It has rich historical roots and is perhaps best known for the Eassie Stone, a remarkably preserved Pictish cross-slab dating to the late AD 600s. Housed in a purpose-built shelter within the ruins of the Old Parish Church, this intricately carved relic offers a fascinating glimpse into Scotland&rsquo;s early past and draws interest from historians and visitors alike. The nearby A-listed Glamis Castle, arguably one of Scotland&rsquo;s most beautiful castles, is also a real draw to the area, its impressive gardens and fifteenth/sixteenth-century architecture a marvel to behold. Families will appreciate the variety of things to do and explore, as well as the local schooling at both nursery and primary level. Further educational facilities are available in Forfar and Dundee city centre is just 30 minutes away by car, placing the highly regarded university within easy commuting distance. For amenities, nearby Forfar caters to your everyday needs with supermarkets, convenience stores, and independent shops. It is also home to leisure centres, play parks, and scenic walking routes around Forfar Loch, ensuring residents enjoy both convenience and outdoor adventure. Dundee has further shopping and recreational facilities, including superb museums, theatres, shopping centres, and rail and air travel. The city of Perth can also be reached in approximately 40 minutes by car as well. Whether you are drawn by its heritage, its rural serenity, or its access to wider Angus and beyond, Eassie is a charming village that blends a welcoming character with everyday practicality.</p> <ul> <li>Substantial detached house covering 2634 square feet</li> <li>Vestibule and reception hall with storage</li> <li>Living Room; Dining Room</li> <li>Shaker-style breakfasting kitchen</li> <li>Versatile study/sitting room/sixth double bedroom</li> <li>Five Bedrooms (three en-suite)</li> <li>Family Bathroom</li> <li>LPG Heating; DG; EPC - B</li> <li>Solar-panelled roof to the southeast-facing front</li> <li>Gardens front & rear; Side driveway</li> </ul></div>
