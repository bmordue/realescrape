<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>A bespoke-built three/four-bedroom detached house offering a picturesque coastal lifestyle in sought-after Carnoustie; the outstanding home further boasts a magnificent footprint with substantial accommodation, as well as private parking and spectacular gardens with a southerly-facing aspect.</p>  <p>This rarely available detached house is a deceptively large three/four-bedroom family home that offers an abundance of living space, as well as incredible wraparound gardens and private parking for multiple vehicles. The exclusive residence was bespoke built, complete with hand-crafted joinery finishings made specifically for the property. The home offers high levels of flexibility and unrivalled built-in storage, and it has two en-suites and a five-piece family bathroom, with the luxury of a fitted Jacuzzi. Subject to planning permission, it also provides ample scope for further development with a large store room and office that could be converted into additional bedrooms, on top of expansive garden grounds that could easily accommodate an extension or separate dwelling. The exceptional property further boasts a prime position in the sought-after coastal town of Carnoustie. It is within easy walking distance of excellent amenities, bus and rail links, and well-regarded schools. It is also just a short walk from the beautiful local beach and the world-famous Carnoustie Golf Links.</p>  <p>Entrance &ndash; Welcome to a charming seaside home</p>  <p>The home has a lovely stone-built fa&ccedil;ade that is instantly charming. Continuing the appeal, the front door opens to a traditional vestibule framed by glazed doors that flow through to a central hall. It is an impeccable welcome, one heightened by the neutral d&eacute;cor and generous built-in storage.</p>  <p>Reception rooms &ndash; Reception rooms for every occasion</p>  <p>The heart of the home is an impressive living room, which has an expansive footprint for an assortment of furnishings. It features crisp white d&eacute;cor and a soft carpet, creating an inviting and comfortable environment for daily use. A decorative ceiling rose draws attention to the lofty dimensions, whilst a stunning gas fireplace, with a timber mantelpiece and marble hearth, frames the room. The fire has a chimney flue, and has the potential to be used as an open fire (if desired). Ensuring a light-filled ambience, there is also dual-aspect glazing, with southeast-facing patio doors to the garden and southwest-facing bi-folding doors to a modern conservatory that boasts awe-inspiring garden views. In addition, there is a spacious dining room which openly extends from the entrance hall. It offers plenty of floorspace for a family-sized dining table and a sideboard; plus, it has a southwest-facing aspect and it is conveniently next door to the kitchen.</p>  <p>Kitchen &ndash; A large breakfasting kitchen with lots of storage</p>  <p>Generously appointed with a wealth of wood-fronted cabinets, the dual-aspect kitchen offers fantastic storage alongside sweeping worksurfaces in a complementary hue. The large space affords plenty of room for a breakfasting table too, which is ideal for socialising whilst cooking and for quick meals. It comes with an integrated double oven, five-burner gas hob, and extractor hood, as well as space for a freestanding fridge/freezer and a dishwasher. A utility room is next door, providing additional built-in storage and a quiet area for laundry.</p>  <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Three large bedrooms and a versatile office</p>  <p>The three bedrooms are all spacious doubles that accommodate a wide choice of bedside furnishings, in addition to being equipped with generous built-in wardrobe storage. The principal bedroom is on the ground floor, accompanied by a four-piece en-suite shower room. The second bedroom is also on the ground floor, whereas the third bedroom is on the first floor, just off a naturally-lit landing. It is ideal as a guest suite, and further benefits from an en-suite shower room, which opens out into a substantial store room that is perfect for further development (subject to consent). Providing additional versatility, there is a first-floor office as well, which has a very generous footprint and access to expansive eaves storage. If required, this room could easily be repurposed as a fourth double bedroom, or it could be developed further into a fourth and fifth bedroom sharing a Jack-and-Jill en-suite, subject to planning permission (STPP).</p>  <p>Bathrooms &ndash; A luxurious family bathroom with a Jacuzzi</p>  <p>The principal bedroom has a modern four-piece en-suite shower room, incorporating twin storage-set washbasins, a toilet, and a shower cubicle, whilst the third bedroom also has an en-suite shower room as well. The remainder of the home is served by a luxurious five-piece family bathroom, which features a half-pedestal washbasin, a toilet, a bathtub, a shower cubicle, and a sizeable fitted Jacuzzi &ndash; all enveloped by exquisite tile work.</p>  <p>The property has gas central heating and double-glazed windows throughout.</p>  <p>Garden & Parking &ndash; Incredible wraparound gardens</p>  <p>Providing a truly magical outdoor space for the entire family, the home boasts spectacular wraparound gardens that incorporate a large patio area for alfresco dining and a huge swathe of carefully manicured lawn, framed by established hedgerows and mature trees. The gardens also offer excellent privacy and a suntrap, southerly-facing aspect as well; plus, they extend (via a charming bridge) over Lochty Burn. A garden shed and greenhouse are included. Extensive private parking is provided via a multi-car driveway and a detached double garage, which has three adjacent garden stores.</p>  <p>Extras: all fitted floor and window coverings, light fittings, and integrated kitchen appliances to be included in the sale. Additional freestanding appliances and furnishings may be available upon request by separate negotiation. An Etesia Bahia ride-on lawnmower and a Honda petrol Flymo lawnmower are available upon request by separate negotiation as well.</p>  <p>Area</p>  <p>Carnoustie</p>  <p>Situated thirteen miles from the city of Dundee, the coastal town of Carnoustie is a mecca for golf enthusiasts, and famed for its world class links golf course, last host to the Open Golf Championship in 2018. With its foundations in local agriculture and the textile industry, this Angus town, founded in the 18th century, latterly found popularity as a Victorian seaside resort. In the last few decades, it has developed into an ideal spot for commuters. The town itself enjoys excellent local amenities including supermarkets, shops, caf&eacute;s and restaurants, banking and a medical practice, in addition to primary and secondary schooling. A short drive away, the vibrant city of Dundee boasts a full range of high street outlets and a cultural hub, with museums including the world-renowned V&A Dundee. In addition to the championship course (regarded as amongst the toughest in the world) this stretch of east coast is well-known for its outstanding golf courses. The town is surrounded by the beautiful Angus countryside, and its coastal setting offers a wonderful seaside lifestyle, with a promenade, leisure centre, sports facilities and play area, and walks along long stretches of beach in the local area. The town benefits from excellent road links and a train station, with a direct service along the coast to Dundee, making it very well connected not only to the city, but also the surrounding area.&nbsp;</p>  <ul>  <li>Bespoke built and rarely available detached house</li>  <li>A wealth of bright and spacious accommodation (STPP)</li>  <li>Dual-aspect living room with a stunning fireplace</li>  <li>Modern conservatory with inspiring garden views</li>  <li>Spacious dining room with southwest aspect</li>  <li>Generously appointed breakfasting kitchen</li>  <li>4 Bedrooms</li>  <li>2 En-suites & Family Bathroom with Jacuzzi</li>  <li>Substantial store room with creative potential</li> </ul> </div>
