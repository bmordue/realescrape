<div class="readmore">
<div class="pd_description"><p>This traditional detached house in Broughty Ferry, dating back to the early 1900s, offers a wealth of living space, with three reception rooms, a dining kitchen, and a home office, as well as four double bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a separate WC, plus large gardens, a detached double garage, and a multi-car driveway.</p> <p>8 Abercromby Street is a generous, traditional detached house, built in the early 1900s by architect John Turnbull Maclaren and situated on an established street in Broughty Ferry, occupying a large corner plot with mature gardens and excellent private parking. The house has been a well-loved family home over the years, and there is an opportunity for the new owner to utilise the many features of the house to put their own stamp on it. Excellent amenities can be found in the immediate area, such as shops, including high street stores, independent retailers, and supermarkets, transport links, with two train stations a short distance from the property, schools covering primary and secondary levels, and beautiful outdoor spaces, including parks, Broughty Ferry Nature Reserve, and the beach. The heart of Dundee city centre is also just five miles away.</p> <p>Entrance &ndash; Welcoming you into the home</p> <p>The house is screened from the road by neat hedges and a sweeping driveway creates a welcoming approach. The front door opens into a practical entrance vestibule, flowing through to a long, wide hall with built-in storage and a useful WC.</p> <p>Reception rooms & office &ndash; A number of formal and relaxed reception rooms</p> <p>The house accommodates three main reception areas, allowing the new owner to create formal and more relaxed spaces to suit their own needs.</p> <p>The first is an impressive drawing room, occupying a generous footprint and flooded with natural light throughout the day owing to a wealth of glazing, including two bay windows. The room features a grand fireplace, fitted shelving, and warm wood flooring, and it has a sliding door into the neighbouring formal dining room.</p> <p>In the dining room, plenty of space is provided for a large table and chairs to seat multiple diners, sure to appeal to those who love to host dinner parties, alongside additional furniture, whilst a large fireplace surround with a fitted display cabinet above creates a characterful focal point. The dining room also benefits from direct access to the kitchen.</p> <p>A delightful sunroom is connected to the kitchen, offering the perfect space to retreat and relax after meals and boasting a wealth of glazing allowing natural light to stream in throughout the day and framing views of, as well as affording access to, the garden.</p> <p>Finally, a home office offers an ideal quiet space for those who work or study from home, with potential to be utilised in a number of different ways to suit the modern family lifestyle, such as a relaxed TV/family room, a children&rsquo;s playroom, a teenager&rsquo;s den, or a fifth bedroom, if desired.</p> <p>Kitchen &ndash; Large, well-appointed cooking zone with casual dining space</p> <p>The kitchen is appointed with a wide range of cabinetry, plentiful workspace, and splashback panels, with integrated appliances comprising an oven and combination microwave oven, a gas hob, an extractor fan, a fridge, a freezer, and a dishwasher. The kitchen also has plenty of space for a central seated dining area which is ideal for casual meals, morning coffee, and socialising while cooking, whilst a separate utility room (with external access) houses additional cabinets and workspace, a sink, and space for a washing machine.</p> <p>Bedrooms &ndash; Tranquil bedrooms for a peaceful night&rsquo;s rest</p> <p>The home&rsquo;s four bedrooms are all on the first floor, approached via a landing with built-in storage, and consist of four bright and spacious doubles. The particularly generous, dual-aspect principal bedroom is supplemented by a built-in wardrobe and an en-suite shower room, whilst the remaining three bedrooms feature characterful fireplaces.</p> <p>Bathrooms &ndash; Two washrooms, perfect for family life</p> <p>The principal bedroom&rsquo;s en-suite comprises a large corner shower enclosure, a basin, a WC, and vanity storage, whilst a bright bathroom completes the accommodation on offer and features a bath with an overhead shower and a traditionally styled WC-suite.</p> <p>The home is kept warm by a gas central heating system and the windows are a combination of traditional single-glazed sash-and-case in the original part of the house and double glazing in the extension.</p> <p>Gardens & parking &ndash; Vast, beautiful garden grounds and excellent private parking</p> <p>The delightful and beautifully maintained gardens perfectly complement the home&rsquo;s spacious interiors, boasting a generous, manicured lawn, an abundance of well-kept, leafy shrubs, trees, and neat hedges, walkways, and tranquil seating areas for outdoor dining furniture. Outstanding private parking is provided by a detached double garage with electric doors and a multi-car driveway.</p> <p>Extras: All fitted floor coverings, window coverings, light fittings, integrated kitchen appliances, and principal bedroom fitted furniture suite will be included in the sale. Some furniture may be available by separate negotiation.</p> <p>Area</p> <p>Broughty Ferry</p> <p>Some four miles east of Dundee on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, Broughty Ferry promises the best of both worlds: a coastal lifestyle with the vibrant city on its doorstep. During the Industrial Revolution, when Dundee established its wealth in &lsquo;jute, jam and journalism&rsquo;, the former fishing and whaling village of Broughty Ferry was transformed into one of the most affluent suburbs in Europe, which accounts for its rich stock of grand detached villas and mansion houses. The seaside resort remains a popular tourist attraction today, with visitors drawn to its long, sandy beach and esplanade, 15th-century Broughty Castle, and its array of fashionable eating and drinking spots. Broughty Ferry enjoys all the local amenities you would expect of a small town, which are supplemented, of course, with world-class shopping, culture, and heritage in Dundee. The UK&rsquo;s first UNESCO City of Design, Dundee was also named Best Place to Live in Scotland 2019 by The Sunday Times. In addition to excellent road (and public bus) links for local and national travel, Broughty Ferry station operates regular services to Dundee and further afield to Aberdeen, Arbroath, and Edinburgh. Daily flights and direct trains to London are also available from Dundee Airport and Dundee train station, respectively. Broughty Ferry offers education at all levels, with nursery schools, three primary schools, and a secondary school. Independent schooling and childcare options are also available nearby, including the prestigious High School of Dundee.</p> <ul> <li>Traditional (approx. 1909) detached house in Broughty Ferry&nbsp;</li> <li>Spacious and flexible accommodation&nbsp;</li> <li>Opportunity to carry out some modernisation&nbsp;</li> <li>Entrance vestibule and hall with storage and WC&nbsp;</li> <li>Large, dual-aspect drawing room&nbsp;</li> <li>Spacious formal dining room&nbsp;</li> <li>Dining kitchen with separate utility room&nbsp;</li> <li>Light-filled sunroom with garden access&nbsp;</li> <li>Versatile home office&nbsp;</li> <li>Four generous double bedrooms&nbsp;</li> <li>One en-suite shower room&nbsp;</li> <li>Bright family bathroom&nbsp;</li> <li>Gas central heating and a combination of single-glazed sash-and-case and double-glazed windows&nbsp;</li> <li>Large, mature, and beautifully maintained gardens with a charming summerhouse&nbsp;</li> <li>Detached double garage and multi-car driveway&nbsp;</li> </ul></div>
